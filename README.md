# odin-recipes
Hello to all who will briefly read this. This is the first project I've been assigned while doing The Odin Project. This is my Recipe project and in this project I will showcase the few skills that I have learned so far on my coding journey. 

I will showcase basic HTML knowledge such as setting up a boilerplate to ensure compatibility and effectivness when loading a webpage on a web browser. 

I will showcase my skills of basic HTML elements such as ordered lists, unordered lists, headings (with various sizes), using the head of an HTML file to include meta information, containing descriptions for the webpage and different elements such as images so assistive technology can work as intended on my webpage, and inserting relative and absolute links. 

I will showcase my skills of basic CSS principals such as adding selectors to different elements. Specifically images to allow myself to resize the images on each one of my recipe pages to take into account a viewing xperience that would be more pleasureble for the user.
